# Capstone 1 Proposal

For this project, I am primarily interested in expanding my toolset for exploring and analyzing data. I want to be able to generate high-quality graphs and information-conveying charts from a relatively unexplanatory data set so that an untrained or unfamiliar observer can come away from the presentation with adequate understanding of what might be important within that data.

### Expectations

I am a big fan of video games, so I thought using a video game data set would make for an interesting project. I would like to use the League of Legends Diamond Ranked Games data set from Kaggle for this capstone. This data set has columns containing vital team statistics that can be used to show correlation with wins and generate a likelihood prediction for whether a team will win or lose. There are 40 columns, with approx. 20 for each team’s statistics per game, and there are almost 10,000 rows of data. I think this data (because each row is a snapshot of a single game, which is a summary of the game, but not a summary across games) will be suitable for exploration and analysis and is large enough to answer some interesting questions. 

I hope to be able to answer (with some degree of confidence) some long-standing lay-community gamers’ questions, such as:

1. “Is there an advantage to be on either Red or Blue side in a game?” 
2. “At Diamond rank, does vision matter more or less than lane domination or jungle domination?” 
3. “Is cs (last-hit minion-kills) more important than kills at Diamond rank?”

I hope to generate more interesting questions as I explore the data, but these will do to start me on the process of digging into the set.
